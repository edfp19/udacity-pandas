# Introduction to Data Analysis 

This is part of a submission to the course Introduction to Data Analysis in Python and Numpy by udacity. 

It's very very _very_ simple because I wanted to refresh my pandas/numpy for another project. 

I think you could very well expand this analysis to include a more statistical approach but honestly, you have to manage the time you have available.
